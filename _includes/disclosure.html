Our nifty tool can beat the Big Cable lobbying machine &mdash; it floods *all* of the FCC with phone calls every day. It's now or never to send a clear message to all of the FCC that we won't be ignored and we won't accept a watered down compromise.  The FCC must stand with Obama and the millions of Internet users whoâ€™ve called for strong Title II rules.

    We'll connect you to a senior or mid-level employee at the FCC. If you like
    (and we recommend it!) you can choose to keep calling the FCC every day
    until they make their final decision. We won't use your phone number for
    anything else, we promise.

    If your phone number is based outside of the U.S., it will not work with this call tool. But don't fret about it! You can still <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/">sign our letter for net neutrality here</a>.

Oh, and this Thursday, there are nationwide protests for net neutrality. <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/">Find one near you</a>.
