<h1>Urgent: Net neutrality decision is imminent. Call the FCC every day.</h1>
<p>
    There's bad news. Right now, it looks like the FCC may be deciding to advance a proposal that "looks" like it saves net neutrality but lets still lets Cable companies control and censor the Internet. As we speak, Cable is spending millions of dollars lobbying to make sure that comes true. But, our nifty tool can beat their machine -- it floods *all* of the FCC with phone calls every day. It's now or never to send a clear message to all of the FCC that we won't be ignored and we won't accept a watered down compromise.
