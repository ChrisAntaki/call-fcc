    made a strong statement urging the FCC to adopt real
    Net Neutrality rules</a> under “Title II reclassification” — the strongest authority possible.

But FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is dug in: He's trying to delay and still considering passing rules weaker than what we and Obama want — but are great for the cable companies for which Wheeler used to lobby.
